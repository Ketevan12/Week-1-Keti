      <h1>Prompt 1</h1> 
      <p>What classes have you taken where you were exposed to HTML/CSS/JS?
        I took computer science in highschool where we largely focused on python and a bit of javascript. 
        However last semester I learned more about coding in general using more html/css and a bit of JS.</p>
      <h2>Prompt 2 </h2>
      <p> Which parts were the most confusing?
        Javascript was the most confusing for me because the material wasn't fully covered in my class, so I wasn't able to comfortably start using it.</p>p>
